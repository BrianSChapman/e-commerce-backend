# e-commerce-backend

## Description

Transitioning from Mysql and more into Javascript territory again, we were tasked with utilizing the Sequelize NPM package (Along with Express and Dotenv) to build out a responsive back-end database application for an e-commerce retail store. Given some starter code, I built out all applicable database tables, relationships between said tables, API routes, and testing of all route endpoints using Insomnia. I learned a ton about Sequelize syntax, how to build and solidify the relationships between tables using foreign keys, and furthering modularization to be able to pivot successfully into the next major topic, MVC (Model View Controller).

## Installation

After cloning the repository, you'll need to install dependencies ([mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) are all mandatory) and have Mysql shell installed to be able to run the initial schema setup. From there, you can "npm run seed" in the terminal to load the mock data and then run "node server.js" to test the applicable routes.

## Usage

Each of the aforementioned routes (To retrieve, update, and delete data from respective tables: category, product, and tag) has been link to localhost so that they can be tested with ease using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
